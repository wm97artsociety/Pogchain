🧬 POGChain v1.01 — AI-Enhanced Blockchain for Physical & Digital POG Collectibles

complete zip file 

---

📘 Executive Summary

POGChain is a custom-built, Ethereum-compatible Layer 1 blockchain designed for a new generation of hybrid physical-digital collectible pogs. It integrates:

NFT minting (ERC-721/1155 style)

POGCOIN native token economy

AI-driven image recognition scanner

Camera integration for mobile/kiosk scanning

Physical pog redemption and value detection


Built with modular smart contracts, AI classification, and live camera support, this system allows anyone to scan a real POG, have its rarity/value detected, and mint its digital equivalent on-chain.

🧩 Core Features

🔗 1. Blockchain Layer (POGChain Core)

Custom Layer 1 blockchain using Proof-of-Authority (PoA) for low fees and fast blocks.

POGCOIN (POG) native gas and utility token with initial allocation.

NFT support through native logic (in native_token/ and poglogic/) instead of Solidity contracts for zero-gas mints.

Minted pogs can be stored, traded, and burned.


🤖 2. AI Scanner Subsystem (POGVision)

Deep learning model trained using TensorFlow and Keras on real stock photos of POGs.

POG classes:

🟤 normal — common pogs

🔵 cool — stylized or popular artwork

🟣 rare — limited editions, promo pogs

✴️ ultra — holographic, metallic, foil designs


Python-based scanner (kiosk_scanner.py) with OpenCV camera feed classifies physical pogs in real time.

Frontend support coming for in-browser camera scanning (TF.js).


🏪 3. Kiosk and Wallet Redemption System

AI scanner connects to user’s wallet (via browser or QR).

When a pog is scanned:

AI classifies its type and rarity.

A matching NFT is minted on POGChain.

The physical pog can be returned into a kiosk, logged as redeemed.


Users can view their minted pogs, rarity scores, and history via the frontend or wallet.

🛠 How to Use

🧪 Local Dev Instructions

chmod +x bootnode.sh startnode.sh
./startnode.sh                # Starts your blockchain
cd scanner/training
python train_model.py         # Trains AI classifier with stock pogs
cd ..
python kiosk_scanner.py       # Starts camera scanner

🪙 Minting Flow

1. Scan physical pog.


2. AI classifies its type.


3. NFT is minted to user’s wallet.


4. POGCOIN value is granted based on rarity.


5. Physical pog can be returned to a kiosk.

🪙 Rarity → POGCOIN Value Mapping

Rarity	Classification	POGCOIN Reward

Normal	normal	10 POG
Cool	cool	50 POG
Rare	rare	200 POG
Ultra	ultra	1,000 POG



---

🔮 Roadmap

✅ AI training and local scanner

✅ NFT minting per rarity

⏳ Browser-based scanner (TF.js)

⏳ Live frontend wallet + explorer

⏳ Bridge to Ethereum/Base

⏳ On-chain rarity leaderboard



---

🔏 Licensing

AI-trained models must respect usage of publicly available stock image sets.

Physical pog scans are converted to fair-use classification for private collection.
